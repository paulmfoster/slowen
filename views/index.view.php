<div class="box">

<h2>Account List</h2>
<p>
This allows you select which account to view a "register" for.
A register lists all the transactions for that account in order,
along with the balance of the account for each transaction.
Select the account, and you will see the register.
</p>
<h2>Search</h2>
<p>
Allows the user to search for transactions matching a given
payee or category. The first screen allows selection of a payee
or category. The second displays the transactions found.
</p>
<h2>Show Balances</h2>
<p>
In the first screen, you select a date. The following screen
will show the balances of all accounts as of the end of that
date.
</p>
<h2>Transaction Entry</h2>
<p>
This allows the user to enter a transaction into any account
in the system.
</p>
<h2>Reconcile</h2>
<p>
The first screen allows you to select an account. The second
screen shows all the transactions for that account, and allows
the user to mark as "cleared" any transaction which shows up
on your statement. Ultimately, the system then checks that
everything adds up. A message appears telling you whether everything
adds up or doesn't.
</p>
<h2>Audit</h2>
<p>
The first screen allows selection of the month and year. The
next screen shows the balance differences across each account
(using opening and closing dates for that month). It also shows
income and expense amounts for that month. At the end, it checks
all the figures to arrive at a check amount, which should be
zero. This analysis is ideal for ensuring that your figures
are correct for your tax returns. This is exactly what any
tax professional would do in preparing your tax return.

<h2>Payees</h2>

<h2>Select Entity</h2>
<p>
One of the worst things which can happen with taxes is to mix
personal and business income and expenses. It was for this reason
that this setting was extablished. This allows you to specify more
than one entity for which to do accounting. Like your personal versus
your business accounts. Or any other division (like two separate
businesses). No two or more entities can share accounts, payees,
transactions or categories, thus ensuring there's no "leakage"
between different entities.
</p>
<p>
This setting precedes all other work in Slowen. You have to
select an entity before any other work is done in Slowen.
